# AI-RPG
A role playing game for artificial intelligence.
You are not playing this game on your own.   
Instead you are programming an AI for each character in your team and then you can watch playing these characters on there own.
If you have reached max level you are able to play against the team of other players even if they are not online.

On the character creation screen you are able to select from multiple races with there own strengths.  
There are no different classes instead each character can learn skills from different trees.  
These trees are divided into tanking, healing, magical damage and physical damage.

The following games inspired me to build this game: [Gladiabots](https://gladiabots.com/) and [Worlf of Textcraft](http://www.text-craft.com/)
